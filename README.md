# SMFilter_Experiments
provides R codes and RMarkdown files for all the experiments in the paper "State-Space Models on Stiefel Manifold with A New Approach to Nonlinear Filtering"

Notice that you will have to install the package SMFilter before running the RMarkdown code. They can be found here

I wrote the codes and the corresponding RMarkdown in November 2018.

## Simulation.Rmd
The RMarkdown file containing the R code chunks for the experiments.

## Simulation.pdf
The output pdf made by running the RMarkdown code.
